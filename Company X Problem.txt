
Company X Problem:


Company X relies upon telemarketing to sell products. 

The Sales head of the company has hired you to conduct in depth exploratory analyses on the historical data. The objective of the assignemnt is to identify sales pattern 
using all possible combinations of the available fields and implement learnings to drive overall sales (Revenue)

Your project lead wants to utilise the opportunity and prepare a business development case for predictive modelling assignment. The lead has asked you to explore 
different avaliable techniques and preapre a short note on the technique which can be implemented on the business. The lead has also requested you to prepare 
the objective of the model, list additional data requirement and briefly decribe the model- include steps and possible impact on the business.
(Note you do not need to actually build a predictive model).

The column headers are self explanatory, with the 'Sale' column indicating whether a sale was made or not when X called the customer.
